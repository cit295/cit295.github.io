# CIT 295 Practicum Syllabus
CIT 295 Practicum engages students in service-learning opportunities to bless other lives by
using the skills and knowledge they gained through their course of study in the CIT program. It
is designed to help students achieve the mission of BYU-Idaho – “develop disciples of Jesus
Christ who are leaders in their homes, the Church, and their communities” ([University Mission
Statement](https://www.byui.edu/about/byu-idaho-mission-statement)).
